    <h1>Installation Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the AI Image Generation website! This guide will walk you through the process of deploying the React application from the <code>dist</code> folder to your online hosting platform.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to an online hosting provider with file upload capabilities (e.g., cPanel, FTP, or SSH access).</li>
        <li>A domain name (optional, but recommended).</li>
        <li>Basic knowledge of file uploads and hosting platform usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Installation</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare Your Files</h3>
    <p>The build process has generated a folder named <code>dist</code> containing all the necessary files for deployment.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that all files in the <code>dist</code> folder are intact. These are the optimized files for your website.</li>
        <li>If the <code>dist</code> folder is located inside a larger project directory, navigate to this folder and make it ready for upload.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Connect to Your Hosting Account</h3>
    <p>You’ll need to log into your hosting provider to upload the files. You can do this through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cPanel File Manager (common for shared hosting)</li>
        <li>FTP Client (e.g., FileZilla) with your hosting credentials</li>
        <li>SSH (if your hosting provider supports it)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Upload the <code>dist</code> Folder Contents</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the root directory of your website (often named <code>public_html</code> or <code>www</code>).</li>
        <li>Upload the <strong>contents</strong> of the <code>dist</code> folder (do not upload the folder itself, only the files within it) to the root directory.</li>
        <li>Once the files are uploaded, ensure that <code>index.html</code> is in the root directory, as this file serves as the entry point for your React app.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4. Configure Hosting Settings (if needed)</h3>
    <p>Some hosting services require a few additional configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If there’s an <code>.htaccess</code> file in the <code>dist</code> folder, upload it to the root directory as well. This file helps with routing in single-page applications like React.</li>
        <li>If you encounter <strong>404 errors</strong> on page refresh, add the following code to your <code>.htaccess</code> file to ensure all routes redirect to <code>index.html</code>:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L]</code></pre>

    <h3>5. Test Your Application</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit your domain to verify that the application is running as expected.</li>
        <li>Test the image generation feature to ensure the AI model is loading and generating images correctly.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> If your website requires an API key or environment variables, make sure to configure them as instructed. You may need to set these in the hosting dashboard or use a configuration file.
    </div>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If your site is not loading correctly, check the <code>Console</code> tab in your browser’s Developer Tools to identify any errors.</li>
        <li>If you see a blank page, ensure all assets and files (JavaScript, CSS, images) are correctly uploaded.</li>
    </ul>
